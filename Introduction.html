     Typhoons are defined as a tropical cyclone with a maximum
     wind of 34 knots or higher. A tropical cyclone with the maximum 
     wind of less than 34 knots is 
     called a tropical depression. The difference between two 
     types of tropical cyclones are just if the maximum wind is 
     less than or above the threshold of 34 knots.
